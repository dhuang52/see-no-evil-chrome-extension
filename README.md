# blurry Chrome Extension

A Chrome extension to blur out spoliers on Youtube!

Write up a list of spoiler-related words like movie titles, characters, or channel names, and start browsing YouTube spoiler free!

## Features
- ‚úç Editing, deleting, adding, sorting, and searching your spoilers are all supported in the popup for easy management
